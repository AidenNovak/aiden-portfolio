title: "Why I Chose SQLite Over PostgreSQL for a Small Project"

summary: "Sometimes the boring technology choice is the right one. Here's how I decided on a database for a side project."

I was building a small web application to track my study habits. It needed to store: users, study sessions, and some basic analytics. The database choice seemed straightforward until I actually thought about it.

## The Options

I considered three options:

1. **PostgreSQL**: Battle-tested, feature-rich, the default choice for serious applications.
2. **SQLite**: Embedded, zero-config, great for small datasets.
3. **JSON files**: No dependencies, but no querying capabilities.

## The Constraints

I listed my actual constraints:

- **Users**: Just me, maybe a few friends if I shared it.
- **Data**: Maybe 10,000 sessions per year per user.
- **Deployment**: I wanted cheap or free hosting.
- **Complexity**: This is a side project. I didn't want to spend time on DevOps.

## The Tradeoffs

### PostgreSQL

Pros:
- I'd learn skills transferable to work
- Could handle any future growth
- ACID guarantees, concurrent writes

Cons:
- Required a separate database service (Render, Supabase, etc.)
- Connection pooling complexity
- Migration management needed
- Free tiers have limits or sleep issues

### SQLite

Pros:
- Zero configuration
- Single file, easy to backup
- Surprisingly performant for read-heavy workloads
- No network latency
- Free at any scale I'd reach

Cons:
- Doesn't handle concurrent writes well
- No built-in replication
- Not "resume-friendly" technology (some might see it as toy)

## The Decision

I chose SQLite. Here's why:

1. **My workload is essentially single-user.** Even with a few users, the write concurrency would be minimal.

2. **Deployment simplicity.** The database is just a file. I can deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or any static host with serverless functions. No separate database service to manage.

3. **Backup is trivial.** Copy the file. That's it.

4. **It's plenty fast.** For my expected dataset size (~100k rows), queries return in milliseconds.

## The Reality Check

I've been running this for 6 months. The SQLite database file is 2MB. I've never hit a concurrency issue. Deployment takes about 30 seconds.

If this became a real product with thousands of users, I'd migrate to PostgreSQL. But by that point, I'd have product-market fit and could justify the complexity.

## The Meta-Lesson

Framework choices should follow from constraints, not hype. SQLite felt like "not a real database," but for my actual constraints, it was the best choice.

Don't build complexity you might need someday. Build what you need today, and make it easy to change later.
